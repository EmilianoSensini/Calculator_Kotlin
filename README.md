# Calculator_Kotlin
This repository contains my first project using Kotlin and Android. It’s a basic calculator application. Please note that this is not the final version of the app.
In the future, I would like to refactor the entire project to better adhere to programming best practices and improve the app's design and code structure.
Since this was my first time working with these tools, my main focus was on implementing basic functionality.

⚠️ Known Limitations:
  - The app may have some functional issues.
  - I have not conducted exhaustive testing due to time constraints

Any feedback or suggestions are welcome, as they’ll help me improve and learn. Thanks for checking out my project!
